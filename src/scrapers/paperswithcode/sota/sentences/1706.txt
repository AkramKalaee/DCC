In this work, we introduce a new type of linear connections, namedfast-forward connections, based on deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks,and an interleaved bi-directional architecture for stacking the LSTM layers.Fast-forward connections play an essential role in propagating the gradientsand building a deep topology of depth 16.
