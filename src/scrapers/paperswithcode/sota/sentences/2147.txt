Here, wepropose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can betrained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amountof unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data isnecessary).As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of "deep"features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the sourcedomain and (ii) invariant with respect to the shift between the domains.
