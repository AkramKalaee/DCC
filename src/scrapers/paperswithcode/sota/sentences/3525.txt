However, the performance ofthe networks is often limited by budget and time constraints, particularly whentrying to train deep networks.Motivated by the problem of online handwriting recognition, we developed aCNN for processing spatially-sparse inputs; a character drawn with a one-pixelwide pen on a high resolution grid looks like a sparse matrix.
