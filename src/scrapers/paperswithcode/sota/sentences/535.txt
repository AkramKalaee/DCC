We address these issues by introducing the Stack-augmentedParser-Interpreter Neural Network (SPINN), which combines parsing andinterpretation within a single tree-sequence hybrid model by integratingtree-structured sentence interpretation into the linear sequential structure ofa shift-reduce parser.
