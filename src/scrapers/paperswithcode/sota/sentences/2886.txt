By revealing the equivalence of thestate-of-the-art Residual Network (ResNet) and Densely Convolutional Network(DenseNet) within the HORNN framework, we find that ResNet enables featurere-usage while DenseNet enables new features exploration which are bothimportant for learning good representations.
