We present a unifiedimplementation of the Faster R-CNN [Ren et al., 2015], R-FCN [Dai et al., 2016]and SSD [Liu et al., 2015] systems, which we view as "meta-architectures" andtrace out the speed/accuracy trade-off curve created by using alternativefeature extractors and varying other critical parameters such as image sizewithin each of these meta-architectures.
