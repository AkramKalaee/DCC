We illustrate the ability of the model tolearn mutually coherent inference and generation networks through theinspections of model samples and reconstructions and confirm the usefulness ofthe learned representations by obtaining a performance competitive withstate-of-the-art on the semi-supervised SVHN and CIFAR10 tasks.
