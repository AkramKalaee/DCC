The difficulty is particularly pronounced in scale variationsof human body parts when camera view changes or severe foreshortening happens.Although pyramid methods are widely used to handle scale changes at inferencetime, learning feature pyramids in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs)is still not well explored.
