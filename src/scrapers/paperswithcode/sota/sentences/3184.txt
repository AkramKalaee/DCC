We propose (1) improved body part detectors that generate effectivebottom-up proposals for body parts; (2) novel image-conditioned pairwise termsthat allow to assemble the proposals into a variable number of consistent bodypart configurations; and (3) an incremental optimization strategy that exploresthe search space more efficiently thus leading both to better performance andsignificant speed-up factors.
