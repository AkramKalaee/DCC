The Jaccard index, also referred to as the intersection-over-union score, is
commonly employed in the evaluation of image segmentation results given its
perceptual qualities, scale invariance - which lends appropriate relevance to
small objects, and appropriate counting of false negatives, in comparison to
per-pixel losses.
