Then most existing modelsusually utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-basedoperation only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector.However, the features on the feature vector dimension are not mutuallyindependent, and simply applying 1D pooling operation over the time-stepdimension independently may destroy the structure of the featurerepresentation.
