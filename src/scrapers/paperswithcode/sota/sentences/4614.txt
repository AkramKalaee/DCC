This paper presents a real-time face detector, named Single ShotScale-invariant Face Detector (S$^3$FD), which performs superiorly on variousscales of faces with a single deep neural network, especially for small faces.Specifically, we try to solve the common problem that anchor-based detectorsdeteriorate dramatically as the objects become smaller.
