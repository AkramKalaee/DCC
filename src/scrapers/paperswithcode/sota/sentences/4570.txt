The effort devoted to hand-crafting neural network image classifiers hasmotivated the use of architecture search to discover them automatically.Although evolutionary algorithms have been repeatedly applied to neural networktopologies, the image classifiers thus discovered have remained inferior tohuman-crafted ones.
