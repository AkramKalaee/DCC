In this paper, we propose to equip Generative Adversarial Networks with theability to produce direct energy estimates for samples.Specifically, we proposea flexible adversarial training framework, and prove this framework not onlyensures the generator converges to the true data distribution, but also enablesthe discriminator to retain the density information at the global optimal.
