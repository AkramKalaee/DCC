OurPGN reformulates instance-level human parsing as two twinned sub-tasks that canbe jointly learned and mutually refined via a unified network: 1) semantic partsegmentation for assigning each pixel as a human part (e.g., face, arms); 2)instance-aware edge detection to group semantic parts into distinct personinstances.
