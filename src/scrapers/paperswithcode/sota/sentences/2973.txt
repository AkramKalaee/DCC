It is a challenging task due to the large variations inperson pose, occlusion, background clutter, etc How to extract powerfulfeatures is a fundamental problem in ReID and is still an open problem today.In this paper, we design a Multi-Scale Context-Aware Network (MSCAN) to learnpowerful features over full body and body parts, which can well capture thelocal context knowledge by stacking multi-scale convolutions in each layer.Moreover, instead of using predefined rigid parts, we propose to learn andlocalize deformable pedestrian parts using Spatial Transformer Networks (STN)with novel spatial constraints.
