In this paper we present an alternative network that outperformsFlowNet2 on the challenging Sintel final pass and KITTI benchmarks, while being30 times smaller in the model size and 1.36 times faster in the running speed.This is made possible by drilling down to architectural details that might havebeen missed in the current frameworks: (1) We present a more effective flowinference approach at each pyramid level through a lightweight cascadednetwork.
