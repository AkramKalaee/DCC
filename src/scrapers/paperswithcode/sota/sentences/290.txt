Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari showthat ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with thenumber of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based oncommon random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars,making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers.
