Tri-training leverages
three classifiers equally to give pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples, but the
method does not assume labeling samples generated from a different domain.In
this paper, we propose an asymmetric tri-training method for unsupervised
domain adaptation, where we assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples and train
neural networks as if they are true labels.
