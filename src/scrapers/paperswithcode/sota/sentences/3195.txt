Wetrain and test on different sparse and fine data-sets like Pascal VOC2012,Pascal-Context and NYUDv2 and show how better our model performs in this tasks.On the other hand our model has a faster inference time and consumes lessmemory for training and testing on NVIDIA Pascal GPUs, making it more efficientand less memory consuming architecture for pixel-wise segmentation.
