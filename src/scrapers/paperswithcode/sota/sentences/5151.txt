Specifically, designing models with tractablelearning, sampling, inference and evaluation is crucial in solving this task.We extend the space of such models using real-valued non-volume preserving(real NVP) transformations, a set of powerful invertible and learnabletransformations, resulting in an unsupervised learning algorithm with exactlog-likelihood computation, exact sampling, exact inference of latentvariables, and an interpretable latent space.
