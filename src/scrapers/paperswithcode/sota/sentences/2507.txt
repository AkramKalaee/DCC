This ismade possible by 1) the new upsampling layer's much improved reconstructioncapability; and more importantly 2) the DUpsampling based decoder's flexibilityin leveraging almost arbitrary combinations of the CNN encoders' features.Experiments demonstrate that our proposed decoder outperforms thestate-of-the-art decoder, with only $\sim$20\% of computation.
