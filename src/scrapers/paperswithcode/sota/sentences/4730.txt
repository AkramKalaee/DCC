We introduce Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN), a simple and intuitivedeep learning framework for 3D object instance segmentation on point clouds.SGPN uses a single network to predict point grouping proposals and acorresponding semantic class for each proposal, from which we can directlyextract instance segmentation results.
