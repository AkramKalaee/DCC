Experimental results on bAbI, Shortest Path, and
Natural Language Generation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing graph
neural networks, Seq2Seq, and Tree2Seq models; using the proposed
bi-directional node embedding aggregation strategy, the model can converge
rapidly to the optimal performance.
