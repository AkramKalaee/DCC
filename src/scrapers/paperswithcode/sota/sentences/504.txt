The 3D estimatesproduced by our CNN surpass state of the art accuracy on the MICC data set.Coupled with a 3D-3D face matching pipeline, we show the first competitive facerecognition results on the LFW, YTF and IJB-A benchmarks using 3D face shapesas representations, rather than the opaque deep feature vectors used by othermodern systems.
