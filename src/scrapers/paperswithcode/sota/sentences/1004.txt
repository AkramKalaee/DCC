Given that recent architectural innovations are mostly new wordinteraction layers or attention-based matching mechanisms, it seems to be awell-established fact that these components are mandatory for good performance.Unfortunately, the memory and computation cost incurred by these complexmechanisms are undesirable for practical applications.
