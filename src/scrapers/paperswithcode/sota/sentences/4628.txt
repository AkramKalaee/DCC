We show thatIPM-based GANs are a subset of RGANs which use the identity function.Empirically, we observe that 1) RGANs and RaGANs are significantly morestable and generate higher quality data samples than their non-relativisticcounterparts, 2) Standard RaGAN with gradient penalty generate data of betterquality than WGAN-GP while only requiring a single discriminator update pergenerator update (reducing the time taken for reaching the state-of-the-art by400%), and 3) RaGANs are able to generate plausible high resolutions images(256x256) from a very small sample (N=2011), while GAN and LSGAN cannot; theseimages are of significantly better quality than the ones generated by WGAN-GPand SGAN with spectral normalization.
