Weanswer this in three parts: we 1) develop an unsupervised method thatincorporates ReLUs and recent unsupervised regularization techniques, 2)analyze the benefits of unsupervised pre-training compared to data augmentationand dropout on CIFAR-10 while varying the ratio of unsupervised to supervisedsamples, 3) verify our findings on STL-10.
