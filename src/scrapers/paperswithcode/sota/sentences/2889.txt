In particular, on the ImagNet-1k dataset,a shallow DPN surpasses the best ResNeXt-101(64x4d) with 26% smaller modelsize, 25% less computational cost and 8% lower memory consumption, and a deeperDPN (DPN-131) further pushes the state-of-the-art single model performance withabout 2 times faster training speed.
