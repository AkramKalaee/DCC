In addition, we also explore howthe Context Encoding Module can improve the feature representation ofrelatively shallow networks for the image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset.Our 14 layer network has achieved an error rate of 3.45%, which is comparablewith state-of-the-art approaches with over 10 times more layers.
