Wetrain a 557 million parameters AmoebaNet model on ImageNet and achieve a newstate-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 / 97.0% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet 2012 dataset.Finally, we use this learned model to finetune multiple popular imageclassification datasets and obtain competitive results, including pushing theCIFAR-10 accuracy to 99% and CIFAR-100 accuracy to 91.3%.
