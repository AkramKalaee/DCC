Question answering is conventionally used toassess RC ability, in both artificial agents and children learning to read.However, existing RC datasets and tasks are dominated by questions that can besolved by selecting answers using superficial information (e.g., local contextsimilarity or global term frequency); they thus fail to test for the essentialintegrative aspect of RC.
