Discriminative model learning for image denoising has been recentlyattracting considerable attentions due to its favorable denoising performance.In this paper, we take one step forward by investigating the construction offeed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNNs) to embrace theprogress in very deep architecture, learning algorithm, and regularizationmethod into image denoising.
