Our final algorithmic contribution is a newprioritized replay algorithm for sequences, which exploits the temporallocality of neighboring observations for more efficient replay prioritization.Using the Atari 2600 benchmarks, we show that each of these innovationscontribute to both the sample efficiency and final agent performance.
