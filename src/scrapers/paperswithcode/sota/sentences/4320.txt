In this work we present a new agent architecture, called Reactor, whichcombines multiple algorithmic and architectural contributions to produce anagent with higher sample-efficiency than Prioritized Dueling DQN (Wang et al.,2016) and Categorical DQN (Bellemare et al., 2017), while giving betterrun-time performance than A3C (Mnih et al., 2016).
