This paper proposes a faster alternative to Bi-LSTMs for NER:Iterated Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (ID-CNNs), which have bettercapacity than traditional CNNs for large context and structured prediction.Unlike LSTMs whose sequential processing on sentences of length N requires O(N)time even in the face of parallelism, ID-CNNs permit fixed-depth convolutionsto run in parallel across entire documents.
