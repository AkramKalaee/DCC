Experimental results on bAbI, Shortest Path, andNatural Language Generation tasks demonstrate that our model achievesstate-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing graphneural networks, Seq2Seq, and Tree2Seq models; using the proposedbi-directional node embedding aggregation strategy, the model can convergerapidly to the optimal performance.
