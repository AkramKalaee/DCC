To the best of our knowledge,there is no recent work making such comparisons in the biomedical context;specifically no detailed analysis of neural models on this data is available.Experimental results show that in general, the neural models outperform thefeature-based models on two benchmark biomedical corpora GENIA and CRAFT.
