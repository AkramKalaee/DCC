The parallel hierarchy enables our model tocompare the passage, question, and answer from a variety of trainableperspectives, as opposed to using a manually designed, rigid feature set.Perspectives range from the word level to sentence fragments to sequences ofsentences; the networks operate only on word-embedding representations of text.When trained with a methodology designed to help cope with limited trainingdata, our Parallel-Hierarchical model sets a new state of the art for {\itMCTest}, outperforming previous feature-engineered approaches slightly andprevious neural approaches by a significant margin (over 15\% absolute).
