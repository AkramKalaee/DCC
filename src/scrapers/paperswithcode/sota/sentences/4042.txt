Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new approach to machine translationthat has shown promising results that are comparable to traditional approaches.A significant weakness in conventional NMT systems is their inability tocorrectly translate very rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relativelysmall vocabularies with a single unk symbol that represents every possibleout-of-vocabulary (OOV) word.
