To remove any remaining dependencies we incorporate anadditional penalty term based on the "Maximum Mean Discrepancy" (MMD) measure.We discuss how these architectures can be efficiently trained on data and showin experiments that this method is more effective than previous work inremoving unwanted sources of variation while maintaining informative latentrepresentations.
