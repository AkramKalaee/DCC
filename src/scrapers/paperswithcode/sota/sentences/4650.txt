We show that an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to recognizeeither English or Mandarin Chinese speech--two vastly different languages.Because it replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neuralnetworks, end-to-end learning allows us to handle a diverse variety of speechincluding noisy environments, accents and different languages.
