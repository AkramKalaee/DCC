We address these issues by introducing the Stack-augmented
Parser-Interpreter Neural Network (SPINN), which combines parsing and
interpretation within a single tree-sequence hybrid model by integrating
tree-structured sentence interpretation into the linear sequential structure of
a shift-reduce parser.
