After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusionto jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way.We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDN with three representative IRapplications, single image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising, andimage compression artifact reduction.
