We have tested these basic networks extensively on manybenchmark visual datasets for different tasks, such as LFW for faceverification, MultiPIE, Extended Yale B, AR, FERET datasets for facerecognition, as well as MNIST for hand-written digits recognition.Surprisingly, for all tasks, such a seemingly naive PCANet model is on par withthe state of the art features, either prefixed, highly hand-crafted orcarefully learned (by DNNs).
