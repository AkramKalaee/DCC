Unlike DRMM, which uses context-insensitive encodings of terms and query-document term interactions, we inject rich context-sensitive encodings throughout our models, inspired by PACRR's (Hui et al., 2017) convolutional n-gram matching features, but extended in several ways including multiple views of query and document inputs.
