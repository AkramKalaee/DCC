We further combine a CIN and a classical DNN into one unifiedmodel, and named this new model eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM).On one hand, the xDeepFM is able to learn certain bounded-degree featureinteractions explicitly; on the other hand, it can learn arbitrary low- andhigh-order feature interactions implicitly.
