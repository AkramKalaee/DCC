The EpiReader is an end-to-end neural
model comprising two components: the first component proposes a small set of
candidate answers after comparing a question to its supporting text, and the
second component formulates hypotheses using the proposed candidates and the
question, then reranks the hypotheses based on their estimated concordance with
the supporting text.
