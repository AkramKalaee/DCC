We approach this from one side by doing a careful
hand-analysis of a small subset of the problems and from the other by showing
that simple, carefully designed systems can obtain accuracies of 73.6% and
76.6% on these two datasets, exceeding current state-of-the-art results by
7-10% and approaching what we believe is the ceiling for performance on this
task.
