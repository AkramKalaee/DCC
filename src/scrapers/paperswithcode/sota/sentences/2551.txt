Experiments on ICDAR 2015, ICDAR 2017 MLT, and ICDAR2013 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-artmethods significantly, which further allows us to develop the first real-timeoriented text spotting system which surpasses all previous state-of-the-artresults by more than 5% on ICDAR 2015 text spotting task while keeping 22.6fps.
