The challenges of shape robust text detection lie in two aspects: 1) mostexisting quadrangular bounding box based detectors are difficult to locatetexts with arbitrary shapes, which are hard to be enclosed perfectly in arectangle; 2) most pixel-wise segmentation-based detectors may not separate thetext instances that are very close to each other.
