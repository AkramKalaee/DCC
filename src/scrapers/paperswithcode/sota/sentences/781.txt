The resultingrepresentation is more robust compared to existing context aggregation schemes,e.g., pyramid pooling modules (PPM) in PSPNet and atrous spatial pyramidpooling (ASPP), which do not differentiate the context pixels belonging to thesame object category or not, making the reliability of contextually aggregatedrepresentations limited.
