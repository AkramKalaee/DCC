Specially, RoIRotate isintroduced to share convolutional features between detection and recognition.Benefiting from convolution sharing strategy, our FOTS has little computationoverhead compared to baseline text detection network, and the joint trainingmethod learns more generic features to make our method perform better thanthese two-stage methods.
