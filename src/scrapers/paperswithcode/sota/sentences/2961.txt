Deep feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activations arecurrently producing the state-of-the-art results in several public datasets.The combination of deep learning models and piecewise linear activationfunctions allows for the estimation of exponentially complex functions with theuse of a large number of subnetworks specialized in the classification ofsimilar input examples.
