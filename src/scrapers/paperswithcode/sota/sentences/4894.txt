Second, we feed the base feature into a block of alternatingjoint Thinned U-shape Modules and Feature Fusion Modules and exploit thedecoder layers of each u-shape module as the features for detecting objects.Finally, we gather up the decoder layers with equivalent scales (sizes) todevelop a feature pyramid for object detection, in which every feature mapconsists of the layers (features) from multiple levels.
