The challenges of shape robust text detection lie in two aspects: 1) most
existing quadrangular bounding box based detectors are difficult to locate
texts with arbitrary shapes, which are hard to be enclosed perfectly in a
rectangle; 2) most pixel-wise segmentation-based detectors may not separate the
text instances that are very close to each other.
