We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerably
simpler than competing domain-adversarial methods, and demonstrate the promise
of our approach by exceeding state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation results
on standard cross-domain digit classification tasks and a new more difficult
cross-modality object classification task.
