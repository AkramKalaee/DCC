We describe Microsoft's conversational speech recognition system, in which wecombine recent developments in neural-network-based acoustic and languagemodeling to advance the state of the art on the Switchboard recognition task.Inspired by machine learning ensemble techniques, the system uses a range ofconvolutional and recurrent neural networks.
