We also show that our sentence embeddings can be utilized in a widevariety of transfer learning tasks, outperforming InferSent on 7 out of 10 andSkipThought on 8 out of 9 SentEval sentence embedding evaluation tasks.Furthermore, our model beats the InferSent model in 8 out of 10 recentlypublished SentEval probing tasks designed to evaluate sentence embeddings'ability to capture some of the important linguistic properties of sentences.
