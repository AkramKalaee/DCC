We achieve the state-of-the-artresults on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks.Moreover, we introduce a novel method to visualize the attention effect of thejoint representations for each learning block using back-propagation algorithm,even though the visual features are collapsed without spatial information.
