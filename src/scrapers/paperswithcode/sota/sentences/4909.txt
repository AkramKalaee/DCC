The proposed methods are applied to the unsupervisedimage generation tasks on CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA, and LSUN bedroom datasets.Results show that the repulsive loss function significantly improves over theMMD loss at no additional computational cost and outperforms otherrepresentative loss functions.
