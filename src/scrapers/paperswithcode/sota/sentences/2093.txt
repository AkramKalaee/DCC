To fully leverage the nearly unlimited corpora andcapture linguistic information of multifarious levels, large-size LMs arerequired; but for a specific task, only parts of these information are useful.Such large-sized LMs, even in the inference stage, may cause heavy computationworkloads, making them too time-consuming for large-scale applications.
