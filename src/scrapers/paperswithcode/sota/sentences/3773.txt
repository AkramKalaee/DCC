An unconventional manifold-preserving algorithm is proposed, which can 1) make the best use of supervision from training data, whose label information is given as pairwise constraints; 2) scale up to large repositories with low on-line time complexity; and 3) be plunged into most existing algorithms, serving as a generic postprocessing procedure to further boost the identification accuracies.
