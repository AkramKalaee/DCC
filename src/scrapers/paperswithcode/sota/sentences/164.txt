In this paper, we present the Lipschitz regularization theory and algorithmsfor a novel Loss-Sensitive Generative Adversarial Network (LS-GAN).Specifically, it trains a loss function to distinguish between real and fakesamples by designated margins, while learning a generator alternately toproduce realistic samples by minimizing their losses.
