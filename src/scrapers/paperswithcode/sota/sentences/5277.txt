Three aspects in convolutionalneural networks (CNN) style architectures are being looked at: (1) transparencyof the intermediate layers to the overall classification; (2)discriminativeness and robustness of learned features, especially in the earlylayers; (3) effectiveness in training due to the presence of the exploding andvanishing gradients.
