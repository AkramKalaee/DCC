We provide competitive results
along with an analysis of our model on many natural sequential tasks including
the bAbI Question Answering, TIMIT speech spectrum prediction, Penn TreeBank,
and synthetic tasks that involve long-term dependencies such as algorithmic,
parenthesis, denoising and copying tasks.
