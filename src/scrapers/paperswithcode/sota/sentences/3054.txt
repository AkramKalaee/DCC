In particular, on the ImagNet-1k dataset,
a shallow DPN surpasses the best ResNeXt-101(64x4d) with 26% smaller model
size, 25% less computational cost and 8% lower memory consumption, and a deeper
DPN (DPN-131) further pushes the state-of-the-art single model performance with
about 2 times faster training speed.
