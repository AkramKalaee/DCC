Typically, those two kinds of methods have their respectivemerits and drawbacks, e.g., model-based optimization methods are flexible forhandling different inverse problems but are usually time-consuming withsophisticated priors for the purpose of good performance; in the meanwhile,discriminative learning methods have fast testing speed but their applicationrange is greatly restricted by the specialized task.
