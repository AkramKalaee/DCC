This novel Fastfood layer is also end-to-endtrainable in conjunction with convolutional layers, allowing us to combine theminto a new architecture, named deep fried convolutional networks, whichsubstantially reduces the memory footprint of convolutional networks trained onMNIST and ImageNet with no drop in predictive performance.
