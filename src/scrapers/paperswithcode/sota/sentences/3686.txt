By pairing monolingual
training data with an automatic back-translation, we can treat it as additional
parallel training data, and we obtain substantial improvements on the WMT 15
task English<->German (+2.8-3.7 BLEU), and for the low-resourced IWSLT 14 task
Turkish->English (+2.1-3.4 BLEU), obtaining new state-of-the-art results.
