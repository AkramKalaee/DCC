We show that the ranking-based variant of NCE gives consistentparameter estimates under weaker assumptions than the classification-basedmethod; we analyze the statistical efficiency of the ranking-based andclassification-based variants of NCE; finally we describe experiments onsynthetic data and language modeling showing the effectiveness and trade-offsof both methods.
