It is thus of great interest to continue thestudy of proper techniques for improving the effectiveness of RNNs inprocessing speech signals.In this paper, we revise one of the most popular RNN models, namely GatedRecurrent Units (GRUs), and propose a simplified architecture that turned outto be very effective for ASR.
