Specifically,for a given vertex, the generative model tries to fit its underlying trueconnectivity distribution over all other vertices and produces "fake" samplesto fool the discriminative model, while the discriminative model tries todetect whether the sampled vertex is from ground truth or generated by thegenerative model.
