Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10,ImageNet, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 show that our algorithm excels indiscovering high-performance convolutional architectures for imageclassification and recurrent architectures for language modeling, while beingorders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art non-differentiable techniques.
