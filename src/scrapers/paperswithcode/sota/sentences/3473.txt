We define the object detection from imagery problem as estimating a verylarge but extremely sparse bounding box dependent probability distribution.Subsequently we identify a sparse distribution estimation scheme, DirectedSparse Sampling, and employ it in a single end-to-end CNN based detectionmodel.
