We empirically show that this oversimple anddata-independent bilinear upsampling may lead to sub-optimal results.In this work, we propose a data-dependent upsampling (DUpsampling) to replacebilinear, which takes advantages of the redundancy in the label space ofsemantic segmentation and is able to recover the pixel-wise prediction fromlow-resolution outputs of CNNs.
