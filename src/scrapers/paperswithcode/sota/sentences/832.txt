Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition,verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniqueswith FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors.Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize theembedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previousdeep learning approaches.
