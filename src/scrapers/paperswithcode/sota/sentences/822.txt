Motivated by
that the label of a pixel is the category of the object that the pixel belongs
to, we introduce an \emph{object context pooling (OCP)} scheme, which
represents each pixel by exploiting the set of pixels that belong to the same
object category with such a pixel, and we call the set of pixels as object
context.
