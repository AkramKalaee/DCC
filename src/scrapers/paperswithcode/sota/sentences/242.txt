We perform experimentson two popular face recognition benchmarks datasets and show that our proposedloss function achieves maximum separability between deep face features ofdifferent identities and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on two major facerecognition benchmark datasets: Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and YouTubeFaces (YTF).
