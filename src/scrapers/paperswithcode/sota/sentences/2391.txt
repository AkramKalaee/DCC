Our
PGN reformulates instance-level human parsing as two twinned sub-tasks that can
be jointly learned and mutually refined via a unified network: 1) semantic part
segmentation for assigning each pixel as a human part (e.g., face, arms); 2)
instance-aware edge detection to group semantic parts into distinct person
instances.
