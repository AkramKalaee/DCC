To address this challenge, weintroduce a novel general end-to-end graph-to-sequence neural encoder-decodermodel that maps an input graph to a sequence of vectors and uses anattention-based LSTM method to decode the target sequence from these vectors.Our method first generates the node and graph embeddings using an improvedgraph-based neural network with a novel aggregation strategy to incorporateedge direction information in the node embeddings.
