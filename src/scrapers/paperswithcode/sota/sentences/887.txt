To address the problem, this paper proposes to optimize the deeprepresentation learning process with Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD).Specifically, with the restraint and relaxation iteration (RRI) trainingscheme, we are able to iteratively integrate the orthogonality constraint inCNN training, yielding the so-called SVDNet.
