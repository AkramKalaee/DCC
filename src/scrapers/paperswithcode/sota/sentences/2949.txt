Recently, very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shownoutstanding performance in object recognition and have also been the firstchoice for dense classification problems such as semantic segmentation.However, repeated subsampling operations like pooling or convolution stridingin deep CNNs lead to a significant decrease in the initial image resolution.Here, we present RefineNet, a generic multi-path refinement network thatexplicitly exploits all the information available along the down-samplingprocess to enable high-resolution prediction using long-range residualconnections.
