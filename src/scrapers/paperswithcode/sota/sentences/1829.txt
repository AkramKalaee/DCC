We train the distillationparser using a structured hinge loss objective with a novel cost thatincorporates ensemble uncertainty estimates for each possible attachment,thereby avoiding the intractable cross-entropy computations required byapplying standard distillation objectives to problems with structured outputs.The first-order distillation parser matches or surpasses the state of the arton English, Chinese, and German.
