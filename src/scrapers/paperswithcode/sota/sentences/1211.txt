This multi-task method integrates an IDclassification loss and a number of attribute classification losses, andback-propagates the weighted sum of the individual losses.Albeit simple, we demonstrate on two pedestrian benchmarks that by learning amore discriminative representation, our method significantly improves the re-IDbaseline and is scalable on large galleries.
