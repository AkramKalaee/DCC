In contrastto the existing discriminative denoisers, FFDNet enjoys several desirableproperties, including (i) the ability to handle a wide range of noise levels(i.e., [0, 75]) effectively with a single network, (ii) the ability to removespatially variant noise by specifying a non-uniform noise level map, and (iii)faster speed than benchmark BM3D even on CPU without sacrificing denoisingperformance.
