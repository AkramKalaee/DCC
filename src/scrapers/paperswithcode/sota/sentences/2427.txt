Toaddress these challenges, we test three modifications to the standard FastR-CNN object detector: (1) skip connections that give the detector access tofeatures at multiple network layers, (2) a foveal structure to exploit objectcontext at multiple object resolutions, and (3) an integral loss function andcorresponding network adjustment that improve localization.
