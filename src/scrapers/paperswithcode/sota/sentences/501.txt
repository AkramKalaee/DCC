We claim that this is a symptom of a serious but often overlookedproblem with existing methods for single view 3D face reconstruction: whenapplied "in the wild", their 3D estimates are either unstable and change fordifferent photos of the same subject or they are over-regularized and generic.In response, we describe a robust method for regressing discriminative 3Dmorphable face models (3DMM).
