Among other results, we exceed thestate-of-the-art on the RVL-CDIP dataset by using shear transform dataaugmentation and an architecture designed for a larger input image.Additionally, we analyze the learned features and find evidence that CNNstrained on RVL-CDIP learn region-specific layout features.
