Besides, we design anchor scales based on the effective receptivefield and a proposed equal proportion interval principle; 2) improving therecall rate of small faces by a scale compensation anchor matching strategy; 3)reducing the false positive rate of small faces via a max-out background label.As a consequence, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance onall the common face detection benchmarks, including the AFW, PASCAL face, FDDBand WIDER FACE datasets, and can run at 36 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) forVGA-resolution images.
