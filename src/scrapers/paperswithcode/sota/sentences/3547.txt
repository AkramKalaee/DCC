Unlike DRMM,which uses context-insensitive encodings of terms and query-document terminteractions, we inject rich context-sensitive encodings throughout our models,inspired by PACRR's (Hui et al., 2017) convolutional n-gram matching features,but extended in several ways including multiple views of query and documentinputs.
