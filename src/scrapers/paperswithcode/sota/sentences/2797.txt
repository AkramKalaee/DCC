This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using a one network, alsoknown as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network.Hypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found innature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and aphenotype - the main network.
