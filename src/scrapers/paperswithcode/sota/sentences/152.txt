Tri-training leveragesthree classifiers equally to give pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples, but themethod does not assume labeling samples generated from a different domain.Inthis paper, we propose an asymmetric tri-training method for unsuperviseddomain adaptation, where we assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples and trainneural networks as if they are true labels.
