According to the experimental results, the single model of KAR achieves an Exact Match (EM) of $72.4$ and an F1 Score of $81.1$ on the development set of SQuAD, and more importantly, by applying different settings in the data enrichment method to change the amount of the extraction results, there is a $2\%$ variation in the resulting performance of KAR, which implies that the explicit knowledge provided by the data enrichment method plays an effective role in the training of KAR.
