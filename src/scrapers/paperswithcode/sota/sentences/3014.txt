To address thesechallenges, we propose to model the traffic flow as a diffusion process on adirected graph and introduce Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network(DCRNN), a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting that incorporatesboth spatial and temporal dependency in the traffic flow.
