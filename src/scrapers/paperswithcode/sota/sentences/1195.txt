In this paper, we propose to equip Generative Adversarial Networks with the ability to produce direct energy estimates for samples.Specifically, we propose a flexible adversarial training framework, and prove this framework not only ensures the generator converges to the true data distribution, but also enables the discriminator to retain the density information at the global optimal.
