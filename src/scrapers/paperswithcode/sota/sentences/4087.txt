Combining fluency boost learning and inference with convolutional seq2seq models, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance: 75.72 (F_{0.5}) on CoNLL-2014 10 annotation dataset and 62.42 (GLEU) on JFLEG test set respectively, becoming the first GEC system that reaches human-level performance (72.58 for CoNLL and 62.37 for JFLEG) on both of the benchmarks.
