By revealing the equivalence of the
state-of-the-art Residual Network (ResNet) and Densely Convolutional Network
(DenseNet) within the HORNN framework, we find that ResNet enables feature
re-usage while DenseNet enables new features exploration which are both
important for learning good representations.
