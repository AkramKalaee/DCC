In this paper, we propose Path Aggregation Network (PANet) aimingat boosting information flow in proposal-based instance segmentation framework.Specifically, we enhance the entire feature hierarchy with accuratelocalization signals in lower layers by bottom-up path augmentation, whichshortens the information path between lower layers and topmost feature.
