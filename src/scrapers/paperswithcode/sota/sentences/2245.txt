For example, we
demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms
in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including
thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR,
SVHN, COCO, and significant improvements on ImageNet.
