According to the experimental results, the single model of KAR achievesan Exact Match (EM) of $72.4$ and an F1 Score of $81.1$ on the development setof SQuAD, and more importantly, by applying different settings in the dataenrichment method to change the amount of the extraction results, there is a$2\%$ variation in the resulting performance of KAR, which implies that theexplicit knowledge provided by the data enrichment method plays an effectiverole in the training of KAR.
