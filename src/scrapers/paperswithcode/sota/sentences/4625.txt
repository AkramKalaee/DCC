We argue that it shouldalso simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because 1)this would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in themini-batch is fake, 2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and3) in optimal settings, SGAN would be equivalent to integral probability metric(IPM) GANs.We show that this property can be induced by using a relativisticdiscriminator which estimate the probability that the given real data is morerealistic than a randomly sampled fake data.
