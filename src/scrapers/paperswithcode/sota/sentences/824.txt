The resulting
representation is more robust compared to existing context aggregation schemes,
e.g., pyramid pooling modules (PPM) in PSPNet and atrous spatial pyramid
pooling (ASPP), which do not differentiate the context pixels belonging to the
same object category or not, making the reliability of contextually aggregated
representations limited.
