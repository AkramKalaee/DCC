We believe that the deep neural network, which isinherently an algebraic computation system, is not the most effecient way tocapture highly sophisticated human knowledge, for example those highly coupledgeometric characteristics and interdependence between keypoints in human poses.In this work, we propose to explore how external knowledge can be effectivelyrepresented and injected into the deep neural networks to guide its trainingprocess using learned projections that impose proper prior.
