Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best publishedresult by 30% on both datasets.We also introduce the concept of harmonic embeddings, and a harmonic tripletloss, which describe different versions of face embeddings (produced bydifferent networks) that are compatible to each other and allow for directcomparison between each other.
