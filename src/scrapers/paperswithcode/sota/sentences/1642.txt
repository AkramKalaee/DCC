Random Erasing is parameter learning free, easy toimplement, and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based recognition models.Albeit simple, Random Erasing is complementary to commonly used dataaugmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yieldsconsistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, objectdetection and person re-identification.
