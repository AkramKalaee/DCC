This paper: 1) introduces the history of person re-ID and its
relationship with image classification and instance retrieval; 2) surveys a
broad selection of the hand-crafted systems and the large-scale methods in both
image- and video-based re-ID; 3) describes critical future directions in
end-to-end re-ID and fast retrieval in large galleries; and 4) finally briefs
some important yet under-developed issues.
