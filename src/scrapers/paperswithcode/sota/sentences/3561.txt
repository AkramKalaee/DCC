Anunconventional manifold-preserving algorithm is proposed, which can 1) make thebest use of supervision from training data, whose label information is given aspairwise constraints; 2) scale up to large repositories with low on-line timecomplexity; and 3) be plunged into most existing algorithms, serving as ageneric postprocessing procedure to further boost the identificationaccuracies.
