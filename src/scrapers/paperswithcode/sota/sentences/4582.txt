Considering different tasks, we classifymost current re-ID methods into two classes, i.e., image-based and video-based;in both tasks, hand-crafted and deep learning systems will be reviewed.Moreover, two new re-ID tasks which are much closer to real-world applicationsare described and discussed, i.e., end-to-end re-ID and fast re-ID in verylarge galleries.
