Besides, we develop two techniques:mini-batch aware regularization and data adaptive activation function which canhelp training industrial deep networks with hundreds of millions of parameters.Experiments on two public datasets as well as an Alibaba real productiondataset with over 2 billion samples demonstrate the effectiveness of proposedapproaches, which achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-artmethods.
