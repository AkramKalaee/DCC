We argue that it should
also simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because 1)
this would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in the
mini-batch is fake, 2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and
3) in optimal settings, SGAN would be equivalent to integral probability metric
(IPM) GANs.
