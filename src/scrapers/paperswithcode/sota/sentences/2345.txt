This extension has the following two objectives: 1) theselection of the maximum response among the multi-scale filters prevents filterco-adaptation and allows the formation of multiple sub-networks within the samemodel, which has been shown to facilitate the training of complex learningproblems; and 2) the maxout unit reduces the dimensionality of the outputs fromthe multi-scale filters.
