We approach this from one side by doing a carefulhand-analysis of a small subset of the problems and from the other by showingthat simple, carefully designed systems can obtain accuracies of 73.6% and76.6% on these two datasets, exceeding current state-of-the-art results by7-10% and approaching what we believe is the ceiling for performance on thistask.
