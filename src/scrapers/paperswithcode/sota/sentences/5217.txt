To address this issue, we propose a SVDD basedfeature learning algorithm that describes the density and distribution of eachcluster from K-means with an SVDD ball for more robust feature representation.For this purpose, we present a new SVDD algorithm called C-SVDD that centersthe SVDD ball towards the mode of local density of each cluster, and we showthat the objective of C-SVDD can be solved very efficiently as a linearprogramming problem.
