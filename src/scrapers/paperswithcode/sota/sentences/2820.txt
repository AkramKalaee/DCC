However, normalizing along thebatch dimension introduces problems --- BN's error increases rapidly when thebatch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation.This limits BN's usage for training larger models and transferring features tocomputer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, whichrequire small batches constrained by memory consumption.
