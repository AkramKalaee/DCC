However, there has not been a rigorousevaluation regarding the added value of sophisticated compositional functions.In this paper, we conduct a point-by-point comparative study between SimpleWord-Embedding-based Models (SWEMs), consisting of parameter-free poolingoperations, relative to word-embedding-based RNN/CNN models.
