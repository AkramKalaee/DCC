We provide competitive resultsalong with an analysis of our model on many natural sequential tasks includingthe bAbI Question Answering, TIMIT speech spectrum prediction, Penn TreeBank,and synthetic tasks that involve long-term dependencies such as algorithmic,parenthesis, denoising and copying tasks.
