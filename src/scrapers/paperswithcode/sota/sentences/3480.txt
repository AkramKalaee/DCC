Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has obtained state-of-the art performancefor several language pairs, while only using parallel data for training.Target-side monolingual data plays an important role in boosting fluency forphrase-based statistical machine translation, and we investigate the use ofmonolingual data for NMT.
