These include STL10, an unsupervisedvariant of ImageNet, and CIFAR10, where we significantly beat the accuracy ofour closest competitors by 8 and 9.5 absolute percentage points respectively.The method is not specialised to computer vision and operates on any paireddataset samples; in our experiments we use random transforms to obtain a pairfrom each image.
