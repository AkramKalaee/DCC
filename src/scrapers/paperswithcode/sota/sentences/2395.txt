We present a multi-purpose algorithm for simultaneous face detection, facealignment, pose estimation, gender recognition, smile detection, age estimationand face recognition using a single deep convolutional neural network (CNN).The proposed method employs a multi-task learning framework that regularizesthe shared parameters of CNN and builds a synergy among different domains andtasks.
