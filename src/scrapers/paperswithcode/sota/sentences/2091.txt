We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerablysimpler than competing domain-adversarial methods, and demonstrate the promiseof our approach by exceeding state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation resultson standard cross-domain digit classification tasks and a new more difficultcross-modality object classification task.
