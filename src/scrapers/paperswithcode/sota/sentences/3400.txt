Importantly, the proposedtechnique offers the same linear computational complexity and constant learningcomplexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure.Experiments on MNIST and 20NEWS demonstrate the ability of this novel deeplearning system to learn local, stationary, and compositional features ongraphs.
