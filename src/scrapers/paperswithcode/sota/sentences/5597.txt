Three aspects in convolutional
neural networks (CNN) style architectures are being looked at: (1) transparency
of the intermediate layers to the overall classification; (2)
discriminativeness and robustness of learned features, especially in the early
layers; (3) effectiveness in training due to the presence of the exploding and
vanishing gradients.
