Specifically,
for a given vertex, the generative model tries to fit its underlying true
connectivity distribution over all other vertices and produces "fake" samples
to fool the discriminative model, while the discriminative model tries to
detect whether the sampled vertex is from ground truth or generated by the
generative model.
