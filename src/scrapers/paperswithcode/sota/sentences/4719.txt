To matchthe features from global human body and local body parts, a pose driven featureweighting sub-network is further designed to learn adaptive feature fusions.Extensive experimental analyses and results on three popular datasetsdemonstrate significant performance improvements of our model over allpublished state-of-the-art methods.
