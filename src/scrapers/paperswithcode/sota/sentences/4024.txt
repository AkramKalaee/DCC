Attention mechanism has been proven effective on natural language processing.This paper proposes an attention boosted natural language inference model namedaESIM by adding word attention and adaptive direction-oriented attentionmechanisms to the traditional Bi-LSTM layer of natural language inferencemodels, e.g.
