If that assumption is violated, then the piecewise linearactivation units can degenerate into purely linear activation units, which canresult in a significant reduction of their capacity to learn complex functions.Furthermore, as the number of model layers increases, this unbalanced initialdistribution makes the model ill-conditioned.
