State of the art algorithms enumerate anear-exhaustive list of object locations and classify each into: object or not.In this paper, we show that bottom-up approaches still perform competitively.We detect four extreme points (top-most, left-most, bottom-most, right-most)and one center point of objects using a standard keypoint estimation network.We group the five keypoints into a bounding box if they are geometricallyaligned.
