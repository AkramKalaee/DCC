Human pose estimation using deep neural networks aims to map input imageswith large variations into multiple body keypoints which must satisfy a set ofgeometric constraints and inter-dependency imposed by the human body model.This is a very challenging nonlinear manifold learning process in a very highdimensional feature space.
