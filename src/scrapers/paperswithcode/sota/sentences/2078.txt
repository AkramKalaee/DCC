To promote theperformance of directly 3D coordinate regression, we propose a tree-structuredRegion Ensemble Network (REN), which partitions the convolution outputs intoregions and integrates the results from multiple regressors on each regions.Compared with multi-model ensemble, our model is completely end-to-endtraining.
