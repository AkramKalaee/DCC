Solving VQA problems requirestechniques from both computer vision for understanding the visual contents of apresented image or video, as well as the ones from natural language processingfor understanding semantics of the question and generating the answers.Regarding visual content modeling, most of existing VQA methods adopt thestrategy of extracting global features from the image or video, whichinevitably fails in capturing fine-grained information such as spatialconfiguration of multiple objects.
