However, the existing GANs restrict the discriminator to be a binaryclassifier, and thus limit their learning capacity for tasks that need tosynthesize output with rich structures such as natural language descriptions.In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network, RankGAN, forgenerating high-quality language descriptions.
