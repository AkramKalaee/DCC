Our model Sequence-to-convolution Neural Networks(Seq2CNN)consists of two blocks: Sequential Block that summarizes input texts andConvolution Block that receives summary of input and classifies it to a label.Seq2CNN is trained end-to-end to classify various-length texts withoutpreprocessing inputs into fixed length.
