The postprocessingis empirically validated on a variety of lexical-level intrinsic tasks (wordsimilarity, concept categorization, word analogy) and sentence-level tasks(semantic textural similarity and { text classification}) on multiple datasetsand with a variety of representation methods and hyperparameter choices inmultiple languages; in each case, the processed representations areconsistently better than the original ones.
