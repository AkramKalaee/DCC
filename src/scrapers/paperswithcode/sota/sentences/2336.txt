In this work, we focus instead on the channelrelationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the"Squeeze-and-Excitation" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wisefeature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels.We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architecturesthat generalise extremely effectively across different datasets.
