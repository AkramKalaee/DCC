In thispaper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck inimproving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, andpropose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search forparts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly.
