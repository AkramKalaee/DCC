The proposed models not only nicely representthe hierarchical structures of sentences with their layer-by-layer compositionand pooling, but also capture the rich matching patterns at different levels.Our models are rather generic, requiring no prior knowledge on language, andcan hence be applied to matching tasks of different nature and in differentlanguages.
