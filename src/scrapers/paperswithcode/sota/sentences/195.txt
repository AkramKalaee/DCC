While much progress has been made in how to encode a text sequence into asequence of vectors, less attention has been paid to how to aggregate thesepreceding vectors (outputs of RNN/CNN) into fixed-size encoding vector.Usually, a simple max or average pooling is used, which is a bottom-up andpassive way of aggregation and lack of guidance by task information.
