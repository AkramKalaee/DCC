With further observation that point sets areusually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreasedperformance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel setlearning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales.Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep pointset features efficiently and robustly.
