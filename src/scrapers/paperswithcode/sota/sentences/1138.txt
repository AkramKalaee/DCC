Moreover, if a high-quality syntactic parse is already available,it can be beneficially injected at test time without re-training our SRL model.In experiments on CoNLL-2005 SRL, LISA achieves new state-of-the-artperformance for a model using predicted predicates and standard wordembeddings, attaining 2.5 F1 absolute higher than the previous state-of-the-arton newswire and more than 3.5 F1 on out-of-domain data, nearly 10% reduction inerror.
