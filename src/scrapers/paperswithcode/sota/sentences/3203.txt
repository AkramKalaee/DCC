We show its effectiveness for the set reasoning task of
correspondence classification as well as for image restoration, including image
denoising and single image super-resolution, where we outperform strong
convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines and recent non-local models that
rely on KNN selection in hand-chosen features spaces.
