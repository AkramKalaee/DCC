Person re-identification (re-ID) and attribute recognition share a common
target at the pedestrian description. Their difference consists in the
granularity. Attribute recognition focuses on local aspects of a person while
person re-ID usually extracts global representations. Considering their
similarity and difference, this paper proposes a very simple convolutional
neural network (CNN) that learns a re-ID embedding and predicts the pedestrian
attributes simultaneously. This multi-task method integrates an ID
classification loss and a number of attribute classification losses, and
back-propagates the weighted sum of the individual losses.
Albeit simple, we demonstrate on two pedestrian benchmarks that by learning a
more discriminative representation, our method significantly improves the re-ID
baseline and is scalable on large galleries. We report competitive re-ID
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the two datasets.
