The availability of open-source software is playing a remarkable role in the
popularization of speech recognition and deep learning. Kaldi, for instance, is
nowadays an established framework used to develop state-of-the-art speech
recognizers. PyTorch is used to build neural networks with the Python language
and has recently spawn tremendous interest within the machine learning
community thanks to its simplicity and flexibility.
The PyTorch-Kaldi project aims to bridge the gap between these popular
toolkits, trying to inherit the efficiency of Kaldi and the flexibility of
PyTorch. PyTorch-Kaldi is not only a simple interface between these software,
but it embeds several useful features for developing modern speech recognizers.
For instance, the code is specifically designed to naturally plug-in
user-defined acoustic models. As an alternative, users can exploit several
pre-implemented neural networks that can be customized using intuitive
configuration files. PyTorch-Kaldi supports multiple feature and label streams
as well as combinations of neural networks, enabling the use of complex neural
architectures. The toolkit is publicly-released along with a rich documentation
and is designed to properly work locally or on HPC clusters.
Experiments, that are conducted on several datasets and tasks, show that
PyTorch-Kaldi can effectively be used to develop modern state-of-the-art speech
recognizers.
