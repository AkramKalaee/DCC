Person Re-Identification is still a challenging task in Computer Vision due
to variety of reasons. On the other side, Incremental Learning is still an
issue since Deep Learning models tend to face the problem of overcatastrophic
forgetting when trained on subsequent tasks. In this paper, we propose a model
which can be used for multiple tasks in Person Re-Identification, provide
state-of-the-art results on variety of tasks and still achieve considerable
accuracy later on. We evaluated our model on two datasets Market 1501 and Duke
MTMC. Extensive experiments show that this method can achieve Incremental
Learning in Person ReID efficiently as well as for other tasks in computer
vision as well.
