The goal of this paper is to advance the state-of-the-art of articulated pose
estimation in scenes with multiple people. To that end we contribute on three
fronts. We propose (1) improved body part detectors that generate effective
bottom-up proposals for body parts; (2) novel image-conditioned pairwise terms
that allow to assemble the proposals into a variable number of consistent body
part configurations; and (3) an incremental optimization strategy that explores
the search space more efficiently thus leading both to better performance and
significant speed-up factors. Evaluation is done on two single-person and two
multi-person pose estimation benchmarks. The proposed approach significantly
outperforms best known multi-person pose estimation results while demonstrating
competitive performance on the task of single person pose estimation. Models
