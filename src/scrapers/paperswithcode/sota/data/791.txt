We introduce an architecture to learn joint multilingual sentence
representations for 93 languages, belonging to more than 30 different language
families and written in 28 different scripts. Our system uses a single BiLSTM
encoder with a shared BPE vocabulary for all languages, which is coupled with
an auxiliary decoder and trained on publicly available parallel corpora. This
enables us to learn a classifier on top of the resulting sentence embeddings
using English annotated data only, and transfer it to any of the 93 languages
without any modification. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on zero-shot
cross-lingual natural language inference for all the 14 languages in the XNLI
dataset but one. We also achieve very competitive results in cross-lingual
document classification (MLDoc dataset). Our sentence embeddings are also
strong at parallel corpus mining, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the
BUCC shared task for 3 of its 4 language pairs. Finally, we introduce a new
test set of aligned sentences in 122 languages based on the Tatoeba corpus, and
show that our sentence embeddings obtain strong results in multilingual
similarity search even for low-resource languages. Our PyTorch implementation,
pre-trained encoder and the multilingual test set will be freely available.
