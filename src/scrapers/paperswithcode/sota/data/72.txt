Convolutional neural network has recently achieved great success for image
restoration (IR) and also offered hierarchical features. However, most deep CNN
based IR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the
original low-quality images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In
this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this
problem in IR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the
convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to
extract abundant local features via densely connected convolutional layers. RDB
further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the
layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory mechanism. To adaptively
learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and
stabilize the training of wider network, we proposed local feature fusion in
RDB. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion
to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDN with three representative IR
applications, single image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising, and
image compression artifact reduction. Experiments on benchmark datasets show
that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods
for each IR task.
