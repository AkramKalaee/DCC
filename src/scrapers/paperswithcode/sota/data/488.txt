To apply general knowledge to machine reading comprehension (MRC), we propose
an innovative MRC approach, which consists of a WordNet-based data enrichment
method and an MRC model named as Knowledge Aided Reader (KAR). The data
enrichment method uses the semantic relations of WordNet to extract semantic
level inter-word connections from each passage-question pair in the MRC
dataset, and allows us to control the amount of the extraction results by
setting a hyper-parameter. KAR uses the extraction results of the data
enrichment method as explicit knowledge to assist the prediction of answer
spans. According to the experimental results, the single model of KAR achieves
an Exact Match (EM) of $72.4$ and an F1 Score of $81.1$ on the development set
of SQuAD, and more importantly, by applying different settings in the data
enrichment method to change the amount of the extraction results, there is a
$2\%$ variation in the resulting performance of KAR, which implies that the
explicit knowledge provided by the data enrichment method plays an effective
role in the training of KAR.
