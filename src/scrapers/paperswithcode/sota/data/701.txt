Text classification is a challenging problem which aims to identify the
category of texts. Recently, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) are proposed for image
classification. It has been shown that CapsNets have several advantages over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), while, their validity in the domain of
text has less been explored. An effective method named deep compositional code
learning has been proposed lately. This method can save many parameters about
word embeddings without any significant sacrifices in performance. In this
paper, we introduce the Compositional Coding (CC) mechanism between capsules,
and we propose a new routing algorithm, which is based on k-means clustering
theory. Experiments conducted on eight challenging text classification datasets
show the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy compared to the
state-of-the-art approach with significantly fewer parameters.
