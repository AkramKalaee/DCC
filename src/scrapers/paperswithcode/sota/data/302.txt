Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has achieved great success in
face detection. However, it remains a challenging problem for the current face
detection methods owing to high degree of variability in scale, pose,
occlusion, expression, appearance and illumination. In this paper, we propose a
novel face detection network named Dual Shot Face Detector(DSFD), which
inherits the architecture of SSD and introduces a Feature Enhance Module (FEM)
for transferring the original feature maps to extend the single shot detector
to dual shot detector. Specially, Progressive Anchor Loss (PAL) computed by
using two set of anchors is adopted to effectively facilitate the features.
Additionally, we propose an Improved Anchor Matching (IAM) method by
integrating novel data augmentation techniques and anchor design strategy in
our DSFD to provide better initialization for the regressor. Extensive
experiments on popular benchmarks: WIDER FACE (easy: $0.966$, medium: $0.957$,
hard: $0.904$) and FDDB ( discontinuous: $0.991$, continuous: $0.862$)
demonstrate the superiority of DSFD over the state-of-the-art face detectors
(\emph{e.g.}, PyramidBox and SRN). Code will be made available upon
publication.
