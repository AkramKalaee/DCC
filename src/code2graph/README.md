# Code2Graph

## How to run?
The code to graph has been written and tested using Python3.6. Hence, for optimal usage, we suggest performing the following tests in Python3.6.

### Running in Windows and OSX
You can launch the jupyter notebook describing the usage of the code2graph using following ways:

Install the conda environment. 
```
pip install conda
```
After the conda environment is installed, you can launch the jupyter notebook using following scripts.
```
conda create --name c2g python=3.6
activate c2g
cd 'path-to-code2graph-folder'
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=c2g
jupyter notebook
```
### Running in Linux
First install the virtualenv module in python.
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Then run the following scripts to launch the jupyter.
```
virtualenv -p python3.6 c2g
source c2g/bin/activate
cd 'path-to-code2graph-folder'
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=c2g
jupyter notebook
```

Select the kernel 'c2g' in the notebook, and then your notebook is ready to run. If you encounter any issues, please feel free to contact the authors.

## Notebooks

We provide two notebooks implementing the two code graph generation approaches, as detailed in our [report](reports/milestone3/). Sample inputs are provided in the [test folder](core/test/), and the outputs that are generated by the notebooks are saved inside the corresponding data folder (e.g. [VGG16](core/test/VGG16/)).


### Light-Weight Approach

This approach could be tested using the [corresponding notebook](testScript/light_weight.ipynb). Its output is displayed in a new tab as an HTML file. Screenshot of a sample output is provided below:

### Computational Graph Based Approach

This approach could be tested using the [corresponding notebook](testScript/computational_graph_based.ipynb). Its output is displayed in a new tab as an HTML file. Screenshot of a sample output is provided below:
