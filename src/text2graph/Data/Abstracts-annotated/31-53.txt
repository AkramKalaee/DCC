just deﬁne t (xr, xf ) (cid:44) t (xr) − t (xf ) in (15), with 1 − σ(x) = σ(−x) we can obtain rsgans:  e(xr,xf )∼ ˜p(xr)q(xf )[log σ(t (xr) − t (xf ))] e(xr,xf )∼ ˜p(xr)q(xf )[log σ(t (xf ) − t (xr))]  arg max  t  arg max  g  rsgans have demonstrate some potential to improve gans and we will demonstrate more efﬁcient and sustainable progress of t-gans at the section 4. however, rsgans is not the ﬁrst gans which make real samples available during training generator.
