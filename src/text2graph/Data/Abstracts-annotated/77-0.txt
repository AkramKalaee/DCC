current state-of-the-art object objectors are ﬁne-tuned from the off-the-shelf networks pretrained on large-scale classiﬁcation datasets like imagenet, which incurs some accessory problems: 1) the domain gap between source and target datasets; 2) the learning objective bias between classiﬁcation and detection; 3) the architecture limitations of the classiﬁcation network for detection.
