on the generalization task of synthesizing notes for pairs of pitch and instrument not seen during training, sing produces audio with signiÔ¨Åcantly improved perceptual quality compared to a state-of-the-art autoencoder based on wavenet [4] as measured by a mean opinion score (mos), and is about 32 times faster for training and 2, 500 times faster for inference.
