to exploit our relaxation, we propose the neural nearest neighbors block (n3 block), a novel non-local processing layer that leverages the principle of self-similarity and can be used as building block in modern neural network architectures.1 we show its effectiveness for the set reasoning task of correspondence classiÔ¨Åcation as well as for image restoration, including image denoising and single image super-resolution, where we outperform strong convolutional neural network (cnn) baselines and recent non-local models that rely on knn selection in hand-chosen features spaces.
