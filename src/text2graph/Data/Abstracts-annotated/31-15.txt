therefore, any function h making h(log(t)) be a convex function is allowed to use, such as h(t) = −t, h(t) = − log σ(t), h(t) = log(1 − σ(t)), which lead to the following loss of generator:  −t (x), − log σ(t (x)),  log(1 − σ(t (x)))  (6)  1.2 wasserstein gans  an important breakthrough in gans is wasserstein gans (wgans, arjovsky et al.
